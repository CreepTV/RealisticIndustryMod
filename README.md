# RealisticIndustryMod

## Main Idea
the concept of this mod is to bring the complexity and evolution of modern industry to people whilst retaining a base simplicity (that you dont need a PhD to understand a single action) for play value.

## Realisation
this is going to take quite some time and might, if deemed necessary, be moved into a own game, namely RIG[https://github.com/CreepTV/RealisticIndustryGame].
the base idea was that the player starts out in the knowledge and era of steam power in middle europe, close to utilising electricity

## balancing
yes, this is going to be painful to do, but, we'll try to do our best.
if you have any problems with the current as-is, open a issue pls
