# RealisticIndustryMod

## Main Idea
The concept of this mod is to bring the complexity and evolution of modern industry to people whilst retaining a base simplicity (that you dont need a PhD to understand a single action) for play value. I (TheNewGuy) plan to have a massive progression tree that is different from many other tech mods in the way that there isn't a singular, set way to progress each time. This makes for a potentially completely different progression every time you start anew. As Creep mentioned previously, it is planned to be incredibly complex but still fun and understandable to the average user, with a high degree of modularity to many planned features and systems within the mod. I will also make sure there are basically no complete stops in progression (like "hey, i need a huge amount of *insert material*, but *material* takes a long time to make and there isn't any way to make it quicker), to allow for a feeling of constant progression throughout the mod.

## Realisation
This is going to take quite some time (like literally probably over a year) and might, if deemed necessary, be moved into its own game, namely RIG [https://github.com/CreepTV/RealisticIndustryGame]. The base idea was that the player starts out in the knowledge and era of steam power in middle europe, close to utilizing electricity.

## balancing
yes, this is going to be painful to do, but, we'll try to do our best.
if you have any problems with the current as-is, open a issue pls
